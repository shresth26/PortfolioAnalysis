## PortfolioAnalysis

A portfolio is a collection of financial investments like stocks, bonds, commodities, cash, and cash equivalents.

Portfolio analysis is a quantitative method for selecting an optimal portfolio that can strike a balance between maximizing the return and minimizing the risk in various uncertain environments.

It also evaluates the probability of meeting the goals and objectives of a given investment mandate, particularly on a risk-adjusted basis and in light of historical asset class performance, inflation, and other factors. In this mini-project we'll only talk in terms of equity.

One of the key concepts in portfolio management is diversificationâ€”which simply means not to put all your eggs in one basket. Diversification tries to reduce risk by allocating investments among various financial instruments, industries, and other categories. It aims to maximize returns by investing in different areas that would each react differently to the same event.

I have tried to cover and track blue-chip stocks in different industries in our portfolio like software (TCS & HCL tech), banking (HDFC), Paints (Asian Paints), FMCG (Britannia) and multinational conglomerates like Reliance and Hindustan Unilever.
